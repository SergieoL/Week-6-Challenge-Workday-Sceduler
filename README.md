# Week-6-Challenge-Workday-Sceduler

This simple workday scheduler app displays an 8 hour time frame.
Users are able to select any hour that has not yet passed and enter a task to schedule.
If the time of hour has already passed, the hour will change color and the use will not be able to enter any task.
When the time is approaching soon, the task hour will change color to warn the user of the time.
When the save button is clicked, the task corresponding to that row will be saved to local storage.
Upon loading the page, any tasks saved in local storage will be loaded in.
